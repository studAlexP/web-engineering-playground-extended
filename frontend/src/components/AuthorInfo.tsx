      <p>
        Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really
        "in to" wildlife since childhood. He once went to Chester Zoo on
        holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab. He has never seen a
        bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they
        sound cool.
